We introduce our thesis project here, which evolves around testing some of the most popular Pairs Trading strategies in Euronext NV markets.

We have a complete algo for testing the behavior of strategies given data. 

The input data should be in the same structure as "cleanest_data_ever.csv", we cleaned that data from "closeframe.xlsx."

You can use Yahoo Apis or pandas_datareader or yfinance to download the data from Yahoo Finance.

We plan to develop Copula based strategy in the near future and also implement Machine Learning tools for improving the performance of Pairs Trading strategies.
